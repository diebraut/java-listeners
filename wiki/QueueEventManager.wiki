#summary Dispatch events using own thread (not caller / sender thread).

= Introduction =

The QueueEventManager dispatch events using own thread, instead of caller / sender thread.  This is useful when the caller thread should not wait until the event fully processed.  For example, a TCP receiver thread that receiving TCP packet, once received, it decode the packet then add to the event queue, after that, continue receiving the next packet.
